# akifkeyboard

Simple custom keyboard for my personal use. I'm adding features as I go along. 

What's supported:
1. basic layout
2. in memory word level autocomplete and spellcheck with word probabilities 
3. double space inserts dot
4. some special characters
5. some emoji's
6. optimal key button hitboxes. (Same as IOS keyboard this uses larget hitboxes than the actual keyboard button)
7. Interchangeable prediction row for showing special characters/emoji
8. Long press buttons for secondary character
9. Press and slide out for secondary character (allows very fast typing)
10. Long press delete button allows fast delete like IOS keyboard
